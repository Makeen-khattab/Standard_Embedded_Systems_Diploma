# Standard_Embedded_Systems_Diploma
This repository is a structured collection of C programming exercises and projects tailored for embedded systems development. It bridges foundational C concepts with practical embedded applications, providing hands-on experience for writing efficient, hardware-aware code.

Core Focus Areas:
- Embedded-C Fundamentals
- Low-level programming techniques (bit manipulation, memory management).
- Interaction with hardware registers, sensors, and peripherals.
- Real-time constraints and interrupt handling.
- C Programming Essentials
- Basic syntax, functions, pointers, and data structures.
- Optimization strategies for resource-constrained systems.
- Hardware Kit Integration
- Projects for popular embedded platforms.
- Sensor interfacing, GPIO control, and firmware logic
